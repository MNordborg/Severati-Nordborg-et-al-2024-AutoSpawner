This repository consists of data files, scripts from the performed statistical analyses, model fit diagnostics and model predictions. Data was collected for larvae produced using the AutoSpawner system and traditional, manual coral spawning methods in November and December of 2022 for four species of broadcast spawning corals (Acropora kenti, Acropora loripes, Dipsastrea favus and Mycedium elephantotus) to assess the functioning and performance of the AutoSpawner system in the National Sea Simulator at AIMS headquarters in Townsville. For each spawning method data was collected on the number of eggs collected, sperm concentration, fertilisation success, larval survival and larval metamorphosis success. Data was analysed using Bayesian methods in the software R through the RStudio interface.
